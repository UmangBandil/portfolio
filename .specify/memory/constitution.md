# Umang Bandil's Professional Portfolio Website Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Modern & Responsive Design
The portfolio website must be a visually engaging, performant single-page application. It should be responsive and work flawlessly on all devices, from mobile phones to high-resolution desktop screens.

### II. Atomic Design
The project will strictly follow Brad Frost's Atomic Design methodology. All UI components will be organized into atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages. This ensures a scalable and maintainable codebase.

### III. Component-Driven Development
The UI will be built with a clear hierarchy of components. Development should be component-centric, with each component being independently testable and reusable. Storybook will be used for component development and documentation.

### IV. Performance-First
Performance is a critical success metric. The website must achieve a Lighthouse score of over 90, animations must run at a smooth 60fps, and the total gzipped bundle size must be under 500KB.

### V. Accessibility
The website must be accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities. It must comply with WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

### VI. Testability
All code must be testable. The development process includes dedicated phases for testing, including cross-browser testing, performance optimization, and accessibility checks.

## Development Workflow

The development process will follow the phases outlined in the PRD:
1.  **Phase 1: Setup**
2.  **Phase 2: Build Atoms**
3.  **Phase 3: Build Molecules**
4.  **Phase 4: Build Organisms**
5.  **Phase 5: Templates & Pages**
6.  **Phase 6: Polish & Testing**
7.  **Phase 7: Deployment**

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other practices. All development work must adhere to the principles and guidelines outlined in this document. Any amendments to this constitution require documentation, approval, and a migration plan.
